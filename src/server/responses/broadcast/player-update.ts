   * Sent on:
   * 1. Change key state.
   * 2. Change airplane visibility state.
   * 3. Player powerup state update (get or lose shield/inferno).
   * 4. Apply or lose speed upgrades.
   * 5. Player intersects with player's viewport (only once,
   * at the moment of intersection).
   * 6. Player was hitted, if before hit player was invisible.
   * 7. Player stopped (0 speed).
   * 8. Player achieved max speed.
   * 9. Player became visible (prowlers only).
   * 10. Player energy became full.
   * 11. Player energy became min (`PLAYERS_ENERGY.MIN`).
   * 12. Player health became full.
   * 13. Player was repeled.
   * 14. Player took CTF flag.
   * 15. Player drop/lose CTF flag.
   * 16. Periodic broadcast. Each player must emit `PLAYER_UPDATE` event
   * at least one per 3 seconds, otherwise the frontend desides that player
   * disconnected or switched into spectate mode and removes the player object
   * from the screen.
   *
   * Broadcast to all player who sees the event owner or to one player.
