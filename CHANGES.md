## 5.10.0 (March 28, 2020)

Features:

- Optional random spawn time drift of periodic powerups. The value is 30 seconds by default for CTF base shields to make timers useless, which means CTF base shields will spawn after 90 + randomInteger(0, 30) seconds after picked up. Random value updates after each picking. Use `CTF_BASE_SHIELD_RANDOM_INTERVAL` to change the max value of the random interval.

Improvements:

- Players' connection lag detecting (#104). Server tries to detect the player is lagging and don't kick it if so, the kicks because of flooding should be much less now. A new reason for disconnecting has been added ("info" log level): "Disconnect player due to lag packets amount". "Lag packets" is a new metrics (check in debug command), after player stops lagging, there is a short "grace" period for flooding through its connection. Every packet the server receives during this period counts as lag packet and drops. There is a limit for such packets per connection (for safety reason). After player reaches this limit, its connection will be closed.
- Connections closing methods refactoring. Now the server forcefully closes the second (main or backup) connection if the first one was closed. Improved cleaning from idle connections.
- CTF: the bots are evenly distributed among the teams (#102).
- CTF: ignore spectator in shuffle (#101).

Removed temporary features:

- CTF games history.

## 5.9.0 (March 15, 2020)

Features:

- [`/players`](./docs/commands.md#players) command (#86). Use it to get the stats about playing people and bots. CTF has a specific version of the command: the stats data are grouped by teams and the response is broadcasted to the public chat indicating the player who requested the stats (maximum one broadcast per 15 seconds; for the requests over the limit, a reply is sent as a whisper message). CTF command has an optional parameter: `/players [whisper]`, pass it to omit public broadcasting and get the response as a whisper message. Muted players can't initiate public chat broadcasting, they always get the results as a whisper message.

Improvements:

- Complete commands/bots documentation (#96).

## 5.8.0 (February 28, 2020)

Features:

- CTF: team chat command `#dropnow`. Sometimes q-bots have a bug and they can't drop the flag, this command makes the bots to drop the flag at the time of the request. The bot must be within viewport of the player sending the command.

Bug fixes:

- CTF recovery text alert.

## 5.7.0 (February 25, 2020)

Improvements:

- uWebSockets.js `EXPERIMENTAL_FASTCALL` environment variable (see its repository for details). Enabled (`1`) by default only in docker image. If you run a server directly, please update your .env or pass `EXPERIMENTAL_FASTCALL=1` in production to improve game server performance.
- Configurable WebSockets compression with `WEBSOCKETS_COMPRESSION` variable. Enabled by default. Disabling will improve game server performance.

## 5.6.0 (February 20, 2020)

Improvements:

- Add info about skipped frames since last performance measurement in [/server](./docs/commands.md#server) command. This may help players to determine the source of the cause of the freeze: server or player side.

Bug fixes:

- Prevent long distance teleporting after frame skipping (#93).

## 5.5.0 (February 19, 2020)

Features:

- Automatically add prefix to bot names with [BOTS_NAME_PREFIX](./docs/env-variables.md#bots_name_prefix), no prefix by default. Helps to prevent mimicry. Non-bot players cannot use this prefix.
- New fields `serverConfiguration` and `bots` for server packets `LOGIN`. See `LoginServerConfig` type and protocol lib.
- New field `isBot` for server packets `PLAYER_NEW`. `true` if the player is a bot.

Bug fixes:

- Fix BROADCAST_SCORE_BOARD packet sending order.

Removed temporary features:

- `/horizon` command.

## 5.4.0 (February 13, 2020)

Features:

- CTF: built-in help for Q-bots. Type #help in the chat to get help.

Improvements:

- Add sending of own player packets (PLAYER_UPDATE, PLAYER_FIRE, EVENT_BOUNCE, EVENT_BOOST) via backup connection (in addition to the main connection). This change improves responsiveness of aircraft control for the players. Based on the analysis of the original server logs and the frontend code.

## 5.3.0 (February 12, 2020)

- Configurable AFK disconnect timeout. Use [AFK_DISCONNECT_TIMEOUT](./docs/env-variables.md#afk_disconnect_timeout) to set the timeout value in minutes. By default it is disabled for FFA and CTF, and for BTR it is 10 minutes.

## 5.2.0 (February 11, 2020)

Improvements:

- Forced scoreboard updates for when all players respawn.
- New stats in CTF recovering feature.

Bug fixes:

- Fix moderator passwords check.

## 5.1.2 (February 10, 2020)

Improvements:

- Add recently created storages info in `/server debug` result.

Bug fixes:

- Fix the result of `/profile` command.
- Fix wrong value of CTF statistics.
- Exclude bots from the AFK auto switching (they can't respawn after spectating).
- Fix CTF leader detection for the players with non-unique names.

## 5.0.0 (February 9, 2020)

Features:

- Battle Royale mode. Set SERVER_TYPE to `BTR` to run this mode.
- CTF: `/elections` command. It allows to run the leader elections if the current leader is AFK for 2 minutes. See [commands.md](./docs/commands.md#elections).
- CTF: `/usurp` command. It allows to take over the leader position if the current leader has lower score than the player running the command. One command run per minute per team. See [commands.md](./docs/commands.md#usurp).
- `/profile` command. See [commands.md](./docs/commands.md#profile).
- "Kick" feature in moderator panel.
- Superuser `/server welcome` commands group to change welcome messages without server restart. See [commands.md](./docs/commands.md#server-welcome).
- Superuser `/server ban list` and `/server ban flush` commands. See [commands.md](./docs/commands.md#server-ban-list).

Improvements:

- CTF: automatically switch AFK players at the spawn zone into spectate mode (#75).
- After switching into spectate mode players auto watch: top player or last killer in FFA and BTR; top player or flag carrier in CTF.
- Filter CTF timer alerts (#54).
- Custom limits for packet flooding and spam (#72). Check [PACKETS_LIMIT_ANY](./docs/env-variables.md#packets_limit_any), [PACKETS_LIMIT_CHAT](./docs/env-variables.md#packets_limit_chat), [PACKETS_LIMIT_CHAT_LEAK](./docs/env-variables.md#packets_limit_chat_leak) and [PACKETS_LIMIT_KEY](./docs/env-variables.md#packets_limit_key).
- Adjustable "severity" for non-compliance with protocol (#73). Check [INVALID_PROTOCOL_AUTOKICK_ACK](./docs/env-variables.md#invalid_protocol_autokick_ack), [INVALID_PROTOCOL_AUTOKICK_BACKUP](./docs/env-variables.md#invalid_protocol_autokick_backup) and [INVALID_PROTOCOL_AUTOKICK_PONG](./docs/env-variables.md#invalid_protocol_autokick_pong).
- Players are sorted by type (human/bot) and by name in moderator panel.
- Sending `BROADCAST_CHAT_SERVER_WHISPER` is now safe without any delays after player connect (frontend anti-spam issue resolved).

Bug fixes:

- Spectators or dead players are not allowed to use `/s` (#51).
- "Not enough upgrades" is shown for already fully upgraded skill (#71).
- CTF: the bounty in the match results pop-up is always 1000 bug (#78).
- Prevent the access to undefined connection during commands run.
- Prevent the access to closed connection through side storages.

Breaking changes:

- `crypto-random-string` dependency removed.

Temporary features (will be removed soon, don't use to create any extensions/frontend features):

- `/horizon` command to debug #26.
- After each CTF match, statistics are written to the `cache/matches` directory in files. Use POST requests to `/admin/matches` and `/admin/matches/:timestamp` to download the results; the requests must pass a valid moderator password in the `password` field. The statistics don't contain any personal data (`./src/server/modes/ctf/periodic/player-stats.ts`). This data collecting is part of the preparation for writing a new balance system.
